# Heart Failure Detection Using Artificial Intelligence
- Heart failure is a matter of life and death especially in the developing countries which has the most amount of diseased patients. Early detection of HF can be very helpful and can save many lives. Our goal is to develop a ML model accurate enough to detect that failure which in return can help treat these patients.
- Several Datasets were found and we selected a suitable one with 11 different features and a 1K record count, We also made some preprocessing such as one hot encoding and removing some records with faulty or missing data, we also used a feature selection algorithm to the newly created features and 12 out of 19 features were selected and the rest had very high correlation so they were discarded .
- Since our problem can be a classification type we can turn to the models that will help us in that specific type, several models were used like KNN , SVM and Logistic Regression , after tuning them up using grid search cross validation; the SVM yielded the highest score of 88.3% which is a very satisfying accuracy for us.
